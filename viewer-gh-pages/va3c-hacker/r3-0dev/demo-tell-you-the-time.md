This demo uses text-to-speech functions.
As of this writing (2014-11-26), the [Can I Use]( http://caniuse.com/#search=speech ) web site indicates 
speech support includes the following browsers: Chrome, Safari, and Chrome for Android.

This demo is the first feature that was added to vA3C Hacker. 
Speech (and sound) are just as important as visuals in conveying feeling.
vA3C Hacker supports all senses from the get go.

Future revisions of this demo provide the text in a variety of languages and the text first displayed is the default language of your browser.
Also there is a 3D watch that tells the time, shows moon phases and whatever plus you can see the gears move and if you listen carefully you can hear the watch going 'tick tock'.
