The tour will only run on recent versions of browsers. Only tested on Chrome on Windows. Might run on recent Safari.

Demo fails on both Firefox and Internet Explorer because of lack of speechSynthesis functionality. Must fix.

This is the first audio-visual demo built with vA3C Hacker. It is very much a work-in-progress. 
The vision is to provide tools that are easy enough for an engineer or designer who knows a basic amount of coding to build 3D interactive presentations.
