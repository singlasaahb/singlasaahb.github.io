Browse for files Using File Dialog

<input type=file size="50" onchange=VH.getFile(this,'#random#add=true'); >


Select and open a file.

Files with external texture bitmaps do not load the bitmaps - this is due to security considerations.

Files are place randomly. Future revisions will provide you the ability to supply a full set of parameters prior to opening the file.
