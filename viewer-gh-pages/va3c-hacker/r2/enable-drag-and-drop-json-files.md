Drag and Drop
===


You may now drag and drop files into the model space.

If you drop the file over the menu or this message, there will be a boo boo.

Currently only Three.js JSON, OBJ and STL files are supported. You may load a Three.js HTML file. 
It will instantly overwrite everything you have done,

You may load any template you wish prior to the drag and drop.

Otherwise the 'lights and shadows' template is called automatically.

You may keep on adding files to the current model. 

Use the 
<a href="javascript:(function(){var script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='https://rawgit.com/zz85/zz85-bookmarklets/master/js/ThreeInspector.js';document.body.appendChild(script);})()" title="Why invent your own when you can stand on the shoulders of giants?" >Three.js Inspector</a>
to update position, rotation and scale.
