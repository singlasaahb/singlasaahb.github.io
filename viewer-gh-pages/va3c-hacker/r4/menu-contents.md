<summary><h3>Geometry Shapes Extrusion</h3></summary>

Three.js [Shapes]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/docs/#Reference/Extras.Core/Shape ) (along with path and ExtrudeGeometry ) are one of several very powerful tools that are easy to use. 
And yet they are under utilized - maybe just because there are not enough clear examples that show how easy they are to use.

The [vA3C Hacker Cookbook]( http://va3c.github.io/viewer/va3c-hacker-cookbook/va3c-hacker-cookbook-viewer-r1.html ) Geometry Shapes section begins to provide some simple code examples for creating Three.js Shapes.
