### Any Three.js file can be a template

<input type=file id=inpTemplate onchange=getContentsHTML(); />

### Screen Grabber Template
Issue: If you blog or tweet a lot then it's great to have access to lots of images of the app you are working

Screen capture is the usual way of getting images, but it often takes a lot of snipping and cropping to get things just right

Solution: The Hacker Screen Grabber template allows you to open and load files, tweak them so they are just right, create an image and save it as a PNG file.
