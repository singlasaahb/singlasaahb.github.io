Draggable Objects
===

Temporary stand-in for the [current fail of draggable objects]( https://github.com/zz85/zz85-bookmarklets/issues/8 ) in Three.js Inspector

Code is based on Three.js example [WebGL Interactive Draggable Cubes]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_interactive_draggablecubes.html )

After you load new objects, click the link again to add the new items to the list of draggable objects. Very much a work in progress.

Has issues with some of the Revit files.
