_[Edit Mesh R1]( http://va3c.github.io/viewer/cookbook/edit-mesh/latest/index.html )_  

Original concept created by [zz85]( https://github.com/zz85/ThreeLabs/blob/master/spline3editor.html )


### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* Create, edit and export 3D Catmull Rom Splines 
	* Pan, rotate and zoom in real-time using your pointing device
	* Control point entities highlight when you mouseover
	* Update vertex point positions in a fairly intuitive manner
	* Increment and decrement the number of vertices
	* Export mesh data to JSON file
	* Direct overhead light creating shadows helps locate control point objects

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

## Project Links
vA3C is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All vA3EC scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).
Scripts are hosted on GitHub and are viewable as web pages, as described in the 'Read Me' files and as source code.

## System Requirements

In order to run the script you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the script on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The script is currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
