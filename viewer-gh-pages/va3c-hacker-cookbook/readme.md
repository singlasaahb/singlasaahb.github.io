2015-02-18. Nothing here yet. Or it's broken. It will take some days to complete bringing in examples from vA3C Viewer and Hacker R3.

See <a href=https://github.com/va3c/viewer/tree/gh-pages/va3c-hacker-cookbook/ target=_top title="View files with GitHub" >
GitHub source code</a>
or use [vA3C Hacker Cookbook](va3c-hacker-cookbook-viewer-r1.html) menu.

### Issues

* Highly inconsistent behaviors among the menu items

### Notes
2014-12-28 ~ 
The vA3C Hacker Cookbook is for utilities, demos and hacks that use the various vA3C Hacker functions.

vA3C Viewer Cookbook is about small, standalone JavaScript/HTML files. Also the Viewer Cookbook is an earlier effort with a messy organization.
