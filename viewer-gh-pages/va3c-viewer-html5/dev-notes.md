The app really needs some YouTube videos that shows what it can do.

The standard way would be to use Camtasia and and a human doing voiceovers. 
That would be cool but takes buyong and installing Camtasia. 
[The FOSS solutions are not as good by a long shot. ]
And learning ir. And the making lots of trial and error voice recordings.

So, instead, can we eat out own dog food?

Can we use text-to-speech in Javascript? Can we use event creators and the vA3C API to build self-running demos.
Then using one of the FOSS tools create YouTube videos?

R4 Exporters do not seem to take textures into account.
 
.userData
An object that can be used to store custom data about the Object3d. It should not hold references to functions as these will not be cloned.

Does THREE.ObjectLoader read binary files?
look into var loader = new THREE.XHRLoader();
look into objectUrl to capture texture path for .dae and other files opened with fileReader
